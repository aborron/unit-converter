This project is a metric/imperial unit converter. The unit converter automatically calculates values based on user's input and unit conversions are rounded to three decimal places.

The challenge and design is from Scrimba's ['Learn JavaScript for Free'](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) course.
